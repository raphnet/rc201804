Those files are the result of my RC2018/04 participation.

See: http://www.raphnet.net/divers/retro_challenge_2018_04/index_en.php

All files in this release require a Tandy graphics card, such as what is built
into the Tandy 1000 EX. It won't work on CGA, EGA or VGA.

If using DOSBox, use 'machine=tandy'. Note: The mouse pointer is buggy
in the old version of DOSBox included with debian. It clobbers
on-screen graphics and reports incorrect X coordinates.
